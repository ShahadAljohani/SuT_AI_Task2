# SuT_AI_Task2
Task 2 - Week 3 (Summer Training)

------------
## About this task
A project utilizing OpenCV library to apply a right eye classifier for object detection.

-------------
### Platforms & Tools used:
- Anaconda: A platform for environement and package management
- VSCode
- OpenCV: Computer vision library
------------
#### About OpenCV library
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) it is an open source library for computer vision and machine learning, allows to process images and videos, detect objects, faces and handwriting. 

Features provided: 
- Real-Time video processing
- Comperhensive Image Processing
- Integrarion with Deep Learning

It appeared to correctly detect the owl's right eye, based on the owl's actual (non-inverted) eye position.

-------------
### Steps 
- Installed OpenCV library using the terminal
- Launched VSCode through Anaconda
- Used the Right Eye classifier as found on the `haarcascade_righteye_2splits.xml` file, Adapted excisting code and edited it to fit the needs of the project found on `RightEye Detector.py` file , and i used an Owl video as an input object for right eye detection.
